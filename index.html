            <p>This is a tower defense game about managing your resources to defeat the enemies before they reach the end of the lane.</p>

            <h2>How to Play</h2>
            <p>Drag your mouse over credits to pick them up. Use those credits to buy towers. Select towers at the top by clicking on them. Different towers have different effects, so find out which ones work best. There are also different enemy types, and some towers will be more effective on certain enemies.</p>

            <h2>What was planned</h2>
            <p>Along the developement of this website, a ton of content for this was scrapped. In the future, if I revisit this I might add it. This content includes a boss (which I sprited), a slowing tower, a wave system along with a more intelligent enemy spawning system. Ultimately, all of these proved too complex for the amount of time I needed to work within.</p>
